## `orthologr` version  0.0.4

### New Features 

- Users can now control via the new `delete_corrupt_cds` argument in `dNdS()` and related downstream functions
whether or not corrupted input coding sequences shall be removed prior to dN/dS inference.
In case corrupted CDS exist, the `dNdS()` function will now generate a separate fasta file which
stores all corrupted CDS so that they can be investigated. See issue #8 for details.

#### Function updates

- `dNdS()` receives new argument `delete_corrupt_cds` to remove corrupted input coding sequences (`delete_corrupt_cds` is set to `TRUE` as default)

- `read.cds()` receives new argument `delete_corrupt_cds` to remove corrupted input coding sequences (`delete_corrupt_cds` is set to `TRUE` as default)

- `cds2aa()` receives new argument `delete_corrupt_cds` to remove corrupted input coding sequences (`delete_corrupt_cds` is set to `TRUE` as default)

- `set_blast()` receives new argument `delete_corrupt_cds` to remove corrupted input coding sequences (`delete_corrupt_cds` is set to `TRUE` as default)

- `blast()` receives new argument `delete_corrupt_cds` to remove corrupted input coding sequences (`delete_corrupt_cds` is set to `TRUE` as default)

- `blast_best()` receives new argument `delete_corrupt_cds` to remove corrupted input coding sequences (`delete_corrupt_cds` is set to `TRUE` as default)

- `blast_rec()` receives new argument `delete_corrupt_cds` to remove corrupted input coding sequences (`delete_corrupt_cds` is set to `TRUE` as default)
